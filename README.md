# Fast Principal Component Analysis for Cryo-EM Images

This repository includes the code for implementing the method of the paper [Fast Principal Component Analysis for Cryo-EM Images, arXiv preprint, 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17501).

Our code provides a fast implementation of covariance estimation based on the recent Fourier-Bessel expansion method [Fast Fourier Bessel Expansion](https://github.com/nmarshallf/fle_2d)
